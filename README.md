Excited to Share My First Project at Encryptix! 


I've recently developed an efficient Python application for a To-Do List. This application helps users manage and organize their tasks effectively by allowing them to create, update, and track their to-do lists. Utilizing Python and its libraries, I designed a user-friendly tool that offers seamless task management.
